# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(pre-1.0: the minor version moves for features, the patch version for fixes).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-26

A full-engine safety and correctness review. Seven load/safety defects and a batch
of correctness fixes — each paired with a regression lock test that reproduces the
bug before the fix.

### Fixed
- **Peak-load ceiling enforcement** — a quality session's minimum impulse could push a
  week's mid-week peak acute:chronic load ratio past the hard ceiling at low fitness,
  even though the week-level governor stayed in band. The full-week builder now re-checks
  the peak and drops to an all-easy week when a quality day would breach the ceiling.
- **Readiness medical-stop gate** — a free-text stop symptom (e.g. "chest pain") no longer
  depends on an optional language model to be caught; a deterministic phrase net halts the
  day on its own, and the halt now persists and reduces the prescription instead of
  reverting the next day.
- **Persistent medical hold** — a logged stop symptom now writes a forced-rest directive,
  regenerates the plan, and keeps the day red until cleared, rather than clearing on the
  next calendar day.
- **Post-race recovery block over-prescription** — the fitness-tracking volume floor no
  longer lifts the post-race bridge, so a recovery re-build keeps its conservative shape
  instead of being inflated by a fresh taper's slack governor headroom.
- **Re-plan transparency** — the plan diff now reports per-phase volume and run-frequency
  changes (and any adjustment directive), so a regeneration that raises load can no longer
  be summarised as "no change".
- **Cross-phase week continuity** — an already-lived week that drifts across a phase
  boundary as the race nears is now frozen verbatim from history instead of being
  redrawn under a different phase's shaper.
- **Feasibility honesty bound** — the feasibility check warns "too soon" only when a short
  runway *and* a low projected race-day fitness coincide; a short runway off high fitness,
  or a long runway off a low fitness base, still reads "finish".
- **Re-base runway clamp** — a near-term race can no longer push the taper past race day;
  the introductory re-base block is clamped to the available runway.
- **Output escaping** — remaining user- and engine-supplied strings in the single-page app
  are HTML-escaped (outcomes, diff banner and change list, adjudication and adjustment
  summaries, plan explanation headline).

### Changed
- **Activity sync** — sync now refreshes an activity whose source data was edited after
  import (reported separately from new activities) and no longer double-counts training
  load when a near-duplicate is re-imported after a local delete.

## [0.1.0]

First documented baseline — the deployed state at the start of the changelog.

### Added
- Deterministic running-coach engine: chronic/acute training-load model (fitness, fatigue,
  acute:chronic ratio) with a safety governor that keeps prescribed load in band.
- Dynamic, objective-driven training plans across re-base → base → build → peak → taper
  phases, regenerated and version-diffable on every change.
- Multi-race build chaining: sequential priority-A races planned as one build with
  bridge / peak / taper segments and a priority selector.
- Daily readiness assessment and an effort-discipline monitor that grades each run against
  its prescription.
- Plan-drift view: original plan versus the plan as it stands, with a settle-the-score
  verdict.
- Post-race reckoning: an honest end-of-race endgame.
- Two-instance deployment off one codebase: a public read-only instance (no private data,
  no mutations) and a private full-console instance behind an access gate.
- Security hardening: content-security-policy, security headers, CSRF tokens, a health
  endpoint, and a public/private data-leak and mutation gate.
- In-app self-test harness guarding the engine invariants.
